# horiseon-seo

## Description 

This horiseon-seo project was created to enhance the SEO of Horiseon Marketing Agency's website while adhering to accessibility standards. The client, Horiseon, provided us with existing HTML and CSS files, requesting that we refactor them to improve website accessibility. The optimised webpage not only facilitates easier access for individuals with disabilities but also enhances search engine ranking, ensuring compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act to prevent legal complications.

I have learnt to improved codes by: 
- Amending structure and elements of the HTML file to follow HTML Semantics.
- Adding comments.
- Fixing links in the html file to ensure they are working and not broken.
- Adding alt text to images.
- Changing to a title that describe the website better.
- Using and combining appropriate CSS selectors and properties to ensure CSS language is used efficiently.

## Usage 

To use the Horiseon Marketing Agency webpage, you can go through its various sections to explore their services, service descriptions, and understand how these services can enhance a customer's business. If you wish to review a specific service without having to scroll through the entire page, simply utilise the navigation bar located in the top right corner. From there, select one of the three service options: 'Search Engine Optimization,' 'Online Reputation Management,' or 'Social Media Marketing' by clicking on your choice. This will promptly take you to the desired service section on the webpage, where you can delve into the service descriptions.
